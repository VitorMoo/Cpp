/*ARRAYS
An array is a data structure that is similar to the library vector type (ยง 3.3, p. 96)
but offers a different trade-off between performance and flexibility. Like a vector,
an array is a container of unnamed objects of a single type that we access by position.
Unlike a vector, arrays have fixed size; we cannot add elements to an array.
Because arrays have fixed size, they sometimes offer better run-time performance
for specialized applications*/
